Home furnishing Web Application: Furnishify

The Home furnishing application can provide a platform for customers to purchase home decor items, furniture, lighting, rugs, and other furnishing products online. Some of the key features that can be implemented in a home furnishing e-commerce web-based application are:

Product Listings: The primary feature of the application is product listings. Users can browse through a variety of home furnishing products, view images, and read descriptions to choose the ones they like. This feature can be implemented using annotated POJOs to store product information in a database and annotated controllers to handle product listing requests.

Shopping Cart: Once users have chosen the products they want to purchase, they can add them to their shopping cart. The shopping cart feature can be implemented using session management or by storing cart information in a database. Users can modify the quantities and remove products from their cart before proceeding to checkout.

Checkout: The checkout process is crucial to ensure that users can easily and securely make payments for their purchases. Users can provide their shipping and billing details, select a delivery date, and choose a payment method. Payment processing can be implemented using a third-party payment gateway or by implementing your own payment processing system.

Order Management: Managing orders is important to ensure that orders are fulfilled on time and correctly. Features such as order tracking, order history, and order cancellation can be implemented using Hibernate to store order information in the database and annotated controllers to handle order management requests.

User Management: To make the e-commerce application secure user management features such as user authentication and authorization need to be implemented. Users can create their profiles, view their order history, modify their personal information, and manage their orders.

Search: Users can search for specific home furnishing products by using a search feature that allows them to search by keywords, category, or price range.

Product Reviews: Users can leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.

Special Offers and Promotions: Special offers and promotions can be applied to attract more customers like providing free shipping on orders above a certain amount, and running promotional campaigns during special occasions.

Interior Design Services: Interior design services can be provided where users can consult with professional interior designers who can help them with their home furnishing needs.
